Additionally, the project will aim to identify potential profitable solutions, such as identifying key drivers of sales and identifying trends in the market, and demonstrate the efficiency and advantages of using AI-based predictions over more traditional manual methods. By successfully showcasing these benefits, we hope to persuade companies and corporations to consider implementing AI in their own operations. In order to achieve this goal, we will be gathering and analyzing large amounts of data from the business, using techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization to ensure the quality of the predictions.
